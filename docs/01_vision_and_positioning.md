# GigLedger — Vision & Positioning

## Product Name
**GigLedger**

## One-Line Pitch
GigLedger is an all-in-one business manager that helps freelancers take control of their finances — through unified invoicing, expense tracking, client management, and real-time financial insights in a single mobile-first app.

---

## Vision

Freelancers and solopreneurs are running full businesses from their phones, yet most still juggle 5+ apps for invoicing, expenses, time tracking, and tax prep. They piece together spreadsheets, lose receipts, chase late payments, and dread tax season.

GigLedger exists to bridge that gap.

Our vision is to become the **go-to business command center** for freelancers who want to:
- Create and send professional invoices in under 60 seconds
- Track expenses with photo receipts and auto-categorization
- Manage clients and communication history in one place
- See real-time profit/loss and tax estimates at a glance
- Eventually, automate tax prep and payment reminders

---

## Problem Statement

Current products fall into these categories:
1. **Full accounting software** (QuickBooks, FreshBooks) - Overkill, expensive, steep learning curve
2. **Invoice-only apps** (Invoice Ninja, Wave) - Single-purpose, no expense/client integration
3. **Spreadsheets** (Google Sheets) - Manual, error-prone, no mobile-friendly UX
4. **Generic CRMs** (HubSpot, Notion) - Not designed for freelancer financials

Users who want a simple, integrated freelance business tool are left:
- Switching between 3-5 apps daily
- Manually entering data multiple times
- Missing expense deductions (losing $2,000+/year on average)
- Chasing late invoices without automated reminders
- Scrambling at tax time to reconcile records

This is fragmented, slow, and unsatisfying.

## Solution

GigLedger provides:
- **Unified dashboard** showing income, expenses, and profit in real-time
- **Quick invoicing** with templates, recurring invoices, and payment tracking
- **Smart expense capture** via photo receipts with OCR and auto-categorization
- **Client profiles** with contact info, project history, and notes
- **Tax-ready reports** with quarterly estimates and exportable summaries

We prioritize **simplicity over comprehensiveness** and **speed over customization**.
