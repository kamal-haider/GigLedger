# GigLedger — Monetization & Pricing Strategy

## Purpose

This document defines:
- How GigLedger generates revenue
- Where value boundaries exist

Monetization is designed to be **aligned with user value**, not disruptive.

## 1. Monetization Philosophy

1. [Principle 1 - e.g., Insight > Access]

GigLedger complements existing products rather than competing with them.
